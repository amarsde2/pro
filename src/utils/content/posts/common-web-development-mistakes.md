Mistakes in web development can lead to poor user experience, performance issues, and maintenance nightmares. Here are 10 common pitfalls and how to avoid them:

## 1. Ignoring Mobile Optimization

Not testing your site on different devices can result in broken layouts and frustrated users.

## 2. Not Using Semantic HTML

Using `<div>` for everything? Semantic elements like `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<header>` boost accessibility and SEO.

## 3. No Performance Optimization

Large images, uncompressed assets, and unused code slow down your site. Use tools like:

- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- Code splitting in React
- Lazy loading images

## 4. Hard-Coding Data

Never hard-code dynamic data. Use environment variables, APIs, or CMS for flexibility.

## 5. Inconsistent Naming Conventions

Whether you're using BEM, camelCase, or kebab-caseâ€”stay consistent.

## 6. No Error Handling

Gracefully handle errors in both frontend and backend. Always provide useful fallback UI.

## 7. Forgetting Accessibility (a11y)

Ensure proper contrast, keyboard navigation, and use of ARIA roles.

## 8. Lack of Version Control

If you're not using Git, you're one bug away from disaster.

## 9. Poor File Structure

Keep components modular. Structure code for scalability.

## 10. Not Testing

Manual testing is not enough. Use tools like Jest, Playwright, or Cypress.

## Conclusion

Avoiding these mistakes early in your career will save you hours of debugging and improve your professionalism as a developer.
