Responsive web design is no longer optionalâ€”it's a requirement in today's mobile-first world. With users accessing websites on everything from smartphones to ultra-wide monitors, developers must build fluid interfaces that look great at any size.

## Why Responsive Design Matters

According to recent stats, over 60% of global internet users browse on mobile. A responsive layout ensures:

- Improved user experience
- Better SEO rankings
- Lower bounce rates

## Key Principles of Responsive Design

1. **Mobile-First Approach**  
   Design for the smallest screen first, then enhance for larger devices.

2. **Fluid Grids & Flexible Layouts**  
   Use relative units like percentages or `fr` in CSS Grid/Flexbox.

3. **Media Queries**  
   Customize styles using breakpoints with `@media` rules.

```css
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 2rem;
  }
}
```
